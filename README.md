# DisFluency Detection Using Deep Learning


## Process of the Project

1.  Build a website and connect it to the AWS to save the recorded data which we get live.
2.  Data Analysis and Data Cleaning.
3.  Data Agumentations and Speech Processing tricks for a better output.
4.  Build a Deep Learning Model to Predict the disfluency in speech.



### Website Building and connecting to Github
We have build a simple website using bootstrap and HTML, basic javascript to do some operations in the website. Flask Package is used to deploy the website in Heroku. We have written script in such way that the audio collected is saved in AWS S3 bucket. Then we get to download the data from the bucket for further process. The link of the website is attached below.
